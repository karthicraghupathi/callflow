The callflow sequence diagram generator is a collection of awk and shell 
scripts that will take a packet capture file that can be read by 
wireshark and produce a time sequence diagram. This is useful to view & 
debug SIP callflows or other network traffic.

See manpage of callflow to know how to use it.
