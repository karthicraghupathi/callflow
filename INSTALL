The build instructions are:
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make install

This will install the files in their default locations.

The file locations can be influenced using arguments.
The following once are available:
- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
- CONFDIR
- DOCDIR

So the commands:
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
 make install

Will install most files under /usr instead of /usr/local


Package builders may want to use the commands:
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DDOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/package/callflow -DCONFDIR=/etc
 make install DESTDIR=<package build directory>
