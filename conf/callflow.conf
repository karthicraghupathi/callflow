# COLOR, use to color the arrows
COLORS="black orange sienna red green purple chocolate olivedrab darkred

# FILTER, used to select the frames of interest.
# Default "sip or diameter or isup or megaco (ip.frag_offset > 1300)"
#
# The (ip.frag_offset > 1300) clause is added to obtain at least some information
# when a frame is fragmented.  Due to its size the INVITE message gets quickly
# fragmented, and due to sniffers not capable as re-assembling these frames,
# SIP INVITE messages seem to disappear....
FILTER="sip or diameter or isup or megaco or (ip.frag_offset > 1300)"

# BROWSER, the name of the browser to be used
# Default value: firefox
# Possible values are: firefox, konqueror, chromium, epiphany, opera
BROWSER=

# CALLFLOW_BASE_URL, in case callflow is run on a remote server and the callflow
# can be reached via a browser on the remote server, the base url can be specified
# here.  Example: CALLFLOW_BASE_URL=http://call.flow.eg/~user/callflow
CALLFLOW_BASE_URL=

# CALLFLOW_URL_DIR, works in combination with the CALLFLOW_BASE_URL
# variable.  If the callflow is stored in an additional folder on the
# webserver the additional folder can be specified here.  Especially
# useful in case this folder is different for different callflows.
# In case the folder name does not differ, it can be specified as
# part of the CALLFLOW_BASE_URL
# The complete url is: $CALLFLOW_BASE_URL/$CALLFLOW_URL_DIR
# CALLFLOW_URL_DIR example: $(basename $PWD)
CALLFLOW_URL_DIR=

# WIDTH_BETWEEN_NODES, the distance between the adjacent nodes in the
# callflow diagram.
# Default value = 200
# Minimun value = 100, Maximum value = 250,
WIDTH_BETWEEN_NODES=

# NR_OF_LINES_BETWEEN_NODES, the number of lines after which the node
# labels are repeated
# Default value = 28
# NR_OF_LINES_BETWEEN_NODES=28

# SIP_MSG_FONT_SIZE, font size for the SIP messages frame.
# Default font size: small
# Possible values are CSS defined font size values like small, medium, large
# All values are listed at e.g.: http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_font_font-size.asp
SIP_MSG_FONT_SIZE=

# SHOW_SDP, show detailed SDP information in the callflow
# Default value: yes
SHOW_SDP=yes

# The IP address of the Broadworks SIP server
# Default value: 127.0.0.1
# BW_IP_ADDR=

# ARCHIVE, create an archive containing the callflow.  This archive
# is referenced in callflow landing - and index pages
# Default values: yes
# ARCHIVE=yes

# ARCHIVE_TYPE, archive type: bz2 (bzip2), zip or files
# ARCHIVE_TYPE "bz2" and "zip" makes all callflow related files available
# in the specified archive file.  This archive file can then be distributed.
# ARCHIVE_TYPE "files" echoes all callflow related files to the screen
# Default value: bz2
# ARCHIVE_TYPE=bz2

# Inkscape does not have a quiet option, it might get one in a future release
# Workaround; sent the output to /dev/null when INKSCAPE_MODE value is set QUIET
# Default value: QUIET
INKSCAPE_MODE=QUIET

# Duplicate packet removal:
#
# REMOVE_DUP_MODE, how aggressive should callflow be with respect to removing
# duplicate frames.
#
# There are 3 modes:
# REMOVE_MIRROR_DUPS_2:
#   remove frame if duplicate when the same frame is seen
#   in 5 previous frames or in a window of max 0.5 seconds (the 5 frames have to
#   be transmitted within the 0.5 seconds window).  This mode can be compared
#   to tshark's -d, -D and -w arguments.
#   This is the most advanced remove duplicate frame mode, and adviced to be used
#   
# REMOVE_MIRROR_DUPS:
#   remove frame if prior frame is the same
#
# REMOVE_ALL_DUPS:
#   remove any duplicate frame in trace
REMOVE_DUP_MODE="REMOVE_MIRROR_DUPS_2"
